# NimBLE Nordic UART driver for ESP-IDF
[![Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/masuidrive/nimble-nordic-uart/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/masuidrive/nimble-nordic-uart)

This library implements the Nordic UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) service over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) using the ESP-IDF framework. It's confirmed to work with ESP-IDF.

The library allows for easy communication between an ESP32 device and a BLE client, utilizing the Nordic UART service for a simple, serial-like communication channel.

 
## Features
- Implements the Nordic UART Service (NUS) for BLE communication.
- Provides a simple API for sending and receiving data over BLE.
